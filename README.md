# Hi, I'm Tim! 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer focused on building practical, user-focused apps using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I come from a customer service background and transitioned into software engineering through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

Lately, I’ve been working on apps like **TechCheck**, a matchmaking platform for Street Fighter 6 players. I enjoy shipping real products, diving into backend infrastructure, and occasionally tackling SEO for small businesses.

I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, or a good tech chat — thanks for stopping by!
